The dataset is one of the sample datasets obtained from IBM. It contains the results of an auto insurance company's marketing campaign which offers customers with expiring policies one of four different renewal proposals to retain them. The data has 9134 customer records with 24 variables. The policies for all customers expire between Jan 1 to Feb 28, 2011.

The main objective of the analysis is to understand different customer segments of an auto insurance company and understand how consumers are responding to different renewal offers. To understand what customers to target, a regression model will be built to predict the customer lifetime value. Also, a classfication model will be built to determine if a customer will accept or reject the renewal offer. If the renewal acceptance rate is low, causal inference will be done to see if any potential causes can be determined that are causing people to reject these offers and to better understand what strategy the company should adopt to get more engagement in terms of acceptance to renewal offers.
